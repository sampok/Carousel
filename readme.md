## Carousel

The purpose of this homework is to leverage views, view properties, and events to create a high fidelity prototype that is difficult to distinguish from a production app. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement the Carousel app from the signed out state to the basic signed in state.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I couldn't get the tiles animation right with provided values. Is there a way, or are they intentionally a bit off?
2. The example animation showed modal "Signing in" toast – how could that be done?

### Video Walkthrough

## Notes

- Lack of example of what the "Learn More about Carousel" should look like decreased interest in building it.
